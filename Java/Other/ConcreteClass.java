/*
 * In Java, a concrete class is a class that:

Provides implementation for all of its methods, and

Can be instantiated, i.e., you can create objects from it.

🔹 Key Characteristics of a Concrete Class:
It is not abstract.

It may implement interfaces or extend abstract classes, but it must provide implementation for all abstract methods.

It can contain both instance and static methods and variables.

You can use the new keyword to create objects of it

🧱 Difference from Abstract Class:
Feature	Abstract Class	Concrete Class
Can be instantiated	❌ No	✅ Yes
Can have abstract methods	✅ Yes	❌ No (must implement all methods)
Usage	As a base for subclasses	To create usable objects

📌 Summary:
A concrete class is a fully-defined, instantiable class in Java. 
It serves as the backbone for real-world object creation and functionality in most applications.
